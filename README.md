# work-day-scheduler

## Description
 
I built this project to make a work day scheduler.
The scheduler allows you to put events for specific times in the day.
The scheduler saves whatever you put in in the timeboxes to the local storage so it won't go away when you refresh.
While I was working on this project I learned how to set an array of moment hours.
